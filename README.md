# Female Births Forecasting

## Overview

This project aims to forecast the daily number of female births in California using time series analysis techniques. The dataset consists of daily birth records over 12 months in 1959, providing 365 observations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains the following columns:
- **Date**: The date of the recorded birth.
- **Births**: The number of female births on that date.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, check for missing values, and preprocess the data for analysis.
   
2. **Model Selection**: Experiment with various time series models, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet, to find the most suitable model for forecasting.
   
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   
4. **Forecasting**: Use the selected model to forecast the daily number of female births for future periods.
   
5. **Analysis and Conclusion**: Analyze the results, identify strengths and limitations of the chosen model, and provide insights for further improvement.

## Usage

1. **Dependencies**: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:


2. **Running the Code**: Run the main script to perform data preprocessing, model training, and forecasting:


3. **Results**: The output will include model evaluation metrics and visualizations comparing actual vs. predicted values.

## Files
